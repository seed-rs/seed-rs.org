# New App

There are several ways to create your new Seed app:
1. **Basic Rust-only quickstart**
   - [github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart)
   - It's the simplest quickstart - it's basically a "glue" for basic Rust/WASM tools and it contains a simple example.
   - All examples in next chapters are based on this template.
1. **Webpack quickstart**
   - [github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart-webpack](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart-webpack)
   - Choose this template if you are experienced front-end / Seed developer or when you want to write production apps and like challenges.
   - This website is based on it.
1. **Seeder**
   - [github.com/MartinKavik/seeder](https://github.com/MartinKavik/seeder)
   - Imagine Rust [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), but easier to use and written for Seed. It's in development.

If you are learning Rust or Seed, we recommend to choose [Basic Rust-only quickstart](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart) and follow steps in its README. Once you are able to start development server and see default quickstart's example, we are ready to continue.
