# Events
Events are created by passing [Listener](https://docs.rs/seed/0.1.6/seed/dom_types/struct.Listener.html)s,
or vecs of Listeners into `Node` macros. They're created using the following functions exposed in the prelude: `simple_ev`,
`input_ev`, `keyboard_ev`, `mouse_ev`, and `raw_ev`. The first is demonstrated in the example in the quickstart section,
and all are demonstrated in the todomvc example.

`simple_ev` takes two arguments: an event trigger, which can be a `Seed::Ev` (imported in the prelude), an `&str`, or a 
 `String`, (eg `Ev::Click`, "click", "contextmenu" etc), and an instance
of your `Msg` enum. (eg Msg::Increment). The other three event-creation-funcs
take a trigger, and a [closure](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html) (An anonymous function,
similar to an arrow func in JS) that returns a Msg enum.

`simple_ev` does not pass any information about the event, only that it fired.
Example: 
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Msg {
    ClickClick
}
// ...
simple_ev(Ev::DblClick, Msg::ClickClick)`
```

`input_ev` passes the event target's value field, eg what a user entered in an `input`, `textarea`, or
`select`,  field.
Example: 
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Msg {
    NewWords(String)
}
// ...
// ...
input_ev(Ev::Input, Msg::NewWords)
```

Example `select` element:
```rust
enum Msg {
    ChangeSelected(String)
}
// ... (in update)
ChangeSelected(selected) => {
    log!("Value of the option selected: ", selected);
    Render(Model{selected, ..model})
}

// ...
select![
    attrs!{At::Value => "0"},
    option![attrs!{At::Value => "0"}, "Option A"],
    option![attrs!{At::Value => "1"}, "Option B"],
    option![attrs!{At::Value => "2"}, "Option C"],
    input_ev(Ev::Input, Msg::ChangeSelected)
]
```

`keyboard_ev` returns a [web_sys::KeyboardEvent](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/struct.KeyboardEvent.html),
which exposes several getter methods like `key_code` and `key`. `mouse_ev` works in a similar
way.
Example:
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Msg {
    PutTheHammerDown(web_sys::KeyboardEvent)
}
// ...
keyboard_ev("input", Msg::PutTheHammerDown)
```

Note that in the examples for input_ev and keyboard_ev, the syntax is simplified since
we're only passing the field text, and keyboard event respectively to the Msg. The input_ev
example is Rust shorthand for ```input_ev("input", |text| Msg::NewWords(text))```. If you were
to pass something other than, or more than just the input text (Or KeyboardEvent for keyboard_ev, 
or Event for raw_ev described below),
you can't use this shorthand, and would have to do something like this intead,
explicitly writing the closure:
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Msg {
    NewWords(String, u32)
}
// ...
input_ev("input", move |text| Msg::NewWords(text, 0))
```

`raw_ev` returns a [web_sys::Event](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/struct.Event.html). 
It lets you access any part of any type of
event, albeit with more verbose syntax.
If you wish to do something like `prevent_default()`, or anything not listed above, 
you may need to take this approach. Note that for many common operations, like taking
the value of an input element after an `input` or `change` event, you have to deal with
casting from a generic event or target to the specific one. Seed provides convenience
functions to handle this. They wrap wasm-bindgen's `.dyn_ref()`, from its
[JsCast](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/wasm_bindgen/trait.JsCast.html) trait.

Example syntax showing how you might use raw_ev; processing an input and handling a keyboard
event, while using prevent_default:
```rust
// (in update func)
Msg::KeyPress(event) => {
    event.prevent_default();
    let code = seed::to_kbevent(&ev).key_code();
    // ..
    let target = event.target().unwrap();
    let text = seed::to_input(&target).value();
    
    // ...
    // In view
    raw_ev(Ev::Input, Msg::KeyPress),
}
```
Seed also provides `to_textarea` and `to_select` functions, which you'd use as
`to_input`. It provides `to_html_el`, which is useful for changing settings like `focus`,
and `to_mouse_event`, which you'd use like `to_kbevent`.

This extra step is caused by a conflict between Rust's type system, and the way DOM events
are handled. For example, you may wish to pull text from an input field by reading the event target's
`value` field. However, not all targets contain value; it may have to be represented as
an `HtmlInputElement`. (See [the web-sys ref](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/struct.EventTarget.html), 
and [Mdn ref](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget); there's no value field)) Another example:
If we wish to read the key_code of an event, we must first cast it as a `KeyboardEvent`; pure Events
(`web_sys` and DOM) do not contain this field.

It's likely you'll be able to do most of what you wish with the simpler event funcs.
If there's a type of event or use you think would benefit from a similar func, submit
an issue or PR. In the descriptions above for all event-creation funcs, we assumed minimal code in the closure,
and more code in the update func's match arms. For example, to process a keyboard event,
these two approaches are equivalent:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Msg {
    KeyDown(web_sys::KeyboardEvent)
}

// ... (in update)
KeyDown(event) => {
    let code = event.key_code()
    // ...
}

// ... In view
keyboard_ev("keydown", Msg::KeyDown)
```
and
```rust
enum Msg {
    KeyDown(u32)
}

// ... (in update)
KeyDown(code) => {
    // ...
}

// ... In view
keyboard_ev("keydown", |ev| KeyDown(ev.key_code()))
```

You can pass more than one variable to the `Msg` enum via the closure, as long
as it's set up appropriate in `Msg`'s definition. Note that if you pass a value to the enum
other than what's between ||, you may receive an error about lifetimes. This is corrected by
making the closure a move type. Eg:
```rust
keyboard_ev(Ev::KeyDown, move |ev| Msg::EditKeyDown(id, ev.key_code()))
```
Where `id` is a value defined earlier.

Event syntax may be improved later with the addition of a single macro that infers what the type of event 
is based on the trigger, and avoids the use of manually creating a `Vec` to store the
`Listener`s. For examples of all of the above (except raw_ev), check out the [todomvc example](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed/tree/master/examples/todomvc).

The [todomvc example](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed/tree/master/examples/todomvc) has a number of event-handling examples, including use of raw_ev, 
where it handles text input triggered by a key press, and uses prevent_default().

## Window events
We handle events triggered by the overall window specially, since it doesn't fit directly
into our virtual DOM. We pass to `App::builder::window_events()` a function that accepts a
 ref to `Model`, and returns a `Vec<devents::Listener>`. We use it to control
which listeners are attached to the window based on the model. Excerpt from the
[window_events](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed/blob/master/examples/window_events/src/lib.rs)
example:
```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
enum Msg {
    ToggleWatching,
    UpdateCoords(web_sys::MouseEvent),
    KeyPressed(web_sys::KeyboardEvent),
}

fn update(msg: Msg, model: &mut Model, _: &mut Orders<Msg>) {
    match msg {
        Msg::ToggleWatching => model.watching = !model.watching,
        Msg::UpdateCoords(ev) => model.coords = (ev.screen_x(), ev.screen_y()),
        Msg::KeyPressed(ev) => model.last_keycode = ev.key_code(),
    }
}

// ...

fn window_events(model: &Model) -> Vec<seed::events::Listener<Msg>> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();
    if model.watching {
        result.push(mouse_ev("mousemove", |ev| Msg::UpdateCoords(ev)));
        result.push(keyboard_ev("keydown", |ev| Msg::KeyPressed(ev)));
    }
    result
}


#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn render() {
    App::builder(update, view)
        .window_events(window_events)
        .build_and_start()
}
```
If `model.watching` is `true`, the window listens for keyboard and mouse events, then 
updates the model accordingly. If not, it doesn't listen.
