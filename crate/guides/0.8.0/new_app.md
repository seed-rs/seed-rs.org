# New App

There are several ways to create your new Seed app:

1. **Basic Rust-only quickstart**
   - [github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart)
   - It's the simplest quickstart - it's basically a "glue" for basic Rust/WASM tools and it contains a simple example.
   - All examples in next chapters are based on this template.

1. **Webpack quickstart**
   - [github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart-webpack](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart-webpack)
   - Choose this template if you are experienced frontend / Seed developer or when you want to write production apps and like challenges.
   - This website is based on it.

1. **Seeder**
   - [github.com/MartinKavik/seeder](https://github.com/MartinKavik/seeder)
   - Imagine Rust [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), but easier to use and written for Seed. It's in development.

If you are learning Rust or Seed, we recommend to choose [Basic Rust-only quickstart](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart) and follow steps in its README. Once you are able to start development server and see default quickstart's example, we are ready to continue.

If you are interested to quickly try Seed out, you can also visit an online playground [Play Seed](https://ide.play-seed.dev), check out some default examples in there and experiment with changing them.
