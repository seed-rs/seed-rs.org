# About

## Goals

- Learning the syntax, creating a project, and building it should be easy - regardless
  of your familiarity with Rust.

- Complete documentation that always matches the current version. Getting examples working, and
  starting a project should be painless, and require nothing beyond this guide.

- Expressive, flexible view syntax that's easy to read and write.

## A note on view syntax

This project uses an unconventional approach to describe how to display DOM elements.
It neither uses completely natural (ie macro-free) Rust code, nor
an HTML-like abstraction (eg JSX or templates). My intent is to make the code close
to natural Rust, while streamlining the syntax in a way suited for creating
a visual layout with minimal repetition. The macros used are thin wrappers
for constructors, and don't conceal much.

Specifically, the element-creation macros
allow for accepting a variable number and order of parameters, and the attrs/style macros are
essentially HashMap literals, with wrappers that let element macros know how to distinguish
them.

The lack of resemblance to HTML may be offputting, but the learning
curve is shallow, and I think the macro syntax is close-enough to normal Rust that it's
easy to reason about how to build views, without compartmentalizing it into logic code and display code.
This lack of separation in particular is a controversial decision, but I think the benefits
are worth it.

## Where to start if you're familiar with existing frontend frameworks

Check out the [Code comparison](https://seed-rs.org/guide/code-comparison) section of this guide. Additionally,
the [todomvc example](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed/tree/master/examples/todomvc) is an implementation of 
the [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/),
which has example code in other frameworks that produce identitcal apps. Compare the example in this
project to one on that page that uses a framework you're familiar with.

## Influences

This project is strongly influenced by Elm, React, and Redux. The overall structure
of Seed apps mimicks that of The Elm Architecture.

## There are already several Rust/WASM frameworks; why add another?

I'm distinguishing Seed through clear examples and documentation, and using `wasm-bindgen`/`web-sys` internally. I started this
project after being unable to get existing frameworks working
due to lack of documented examples, and inconsistency between documentation and
published versions. My intent is for anyone who's proficient in a frontend
framework to get a standalone app working in the browser within a few minutes, using just the
quickstart guide.

Seed's different approach to view syntax also distinguishes it:
rather than use an HTML-like markup similar to JSX,
it uses Rust builtin types, thinly wrapped by macros that allow flexible composition.
This decision will not appeal to everyone, but I think it integrates more naturally with
the language.

## Why build a frontend in Rust over Elm, or Javascript-based frameworks?

You may prefer writing in Rust, and using packages from Cargo vice npm. Getting started with
this framework will in most cases be easier, and require less config and setup overhead than
with JS frameworks. You may appreciate Rust's compile-time error-checking, and built-in testing.

You may choose this approach over Elm if you're already comfortable with Rust,
or don't want to code business logic in a purely-functional language.

Compared with React, you may appreciate the consistency of how to write apps:
There's no distinction between logic and display code; no restrictions on comments;
no distinction between components and normal functions. The API is
flexible, and avoids OOP boilerplate. Its integrated routing and message system
avoids the dependency glue-code associated with Redux and React-Router.

Seed has a _batteries-included_ approach, which you may appreciate.

## Why not to use this, and stick with JS

Seed's under rapid development, and breaking changes are likely. Finding Rust/WASM-help,
both in person, and in online communities will be difficult, and finding help for Seed
even more so. Seed doesn't have the wealth of existing reusable _components_ that other frameworks
have, so you will need to implement solved problems (eg date-pickers) yourself, or adapt them
from existing solutions. There are no existing tutorials or guides outside the official one, and
few examples.

Seed doesn't have a track-record of production apps. Finding developers experienced with Rust/wasm-bindgen,
or Seed specifically will be much more difficult than popular JS/compile-to-JS frameworks. Seed's feature-set
is incomplete compared to JS frameworks. Seed hasn't been benchmarked, and its performance may
be lower than JS frameworks.

Seed's view syntax is non-standard compared to HTML-templates, or HTML-mockup languages like
`JSX`.

## What about Gloo ?

We're working closely with the `rustwasm` team on [Gloo](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo), and
intend to incorporate `Gloo` crates into Seed as appropriate, as well as contribute Seed
code into `Gloo` crates. Seed's a cohesive, high-level framework, while `Gloo` will
be a versatile, standardized toolkit.
